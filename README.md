# Sexual Offense Project

### Inequality is always a hot topic in anywhere of the world, espeically in the U.S.. However, every time when people talk about inequality of the minority, they talk about race, mostly black, while ignoring a large portion of population who has been mistreated for decades--females. They endure inequality and social stereotype since in young ages. Sexual directive prints on baby onesies, stereotypical career advice for females, unequal opportunities  in academics, unreasonable limitations for females in workplaces, etc.. They exist everywhere; I can say no girl could say that she has not been mistreated in her entire life. 
### Not everyone can name a person around them who are victim or offender of sexual offense, but it's easy to find a real-life example, or to say, criminal case. Notorious rapist Jeffery Eiberstain and Warren S. Jeffs of Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey; I can already name two just in US. Sexual offense is the worst form of malice agianst women. This project is tend to analyze the victim and offender profiles of sexual offenses and dig deeper into the demographical factors that might correlate with seuxal offense, specifically in 2021.

## As the very beginning, it's important to see the trend of sexual offense cases in US in previous years, from 2013-2019.
