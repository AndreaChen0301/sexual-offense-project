# Sexual Offense Project

### Inequality is always a hot topic in anywhere of the world, espeically in the U.S.. However, every time when people talk about inequality of the minority, they talk about race, mostly black, while ignoring a large portion of population who has been mistreated for decades--females. They endure inequality and social stereotype since in young ages. Sexual directive prints on baby onesies, stereotypical career advice for females, unequal opportunities  in academics, unreasonable limitations for females in workplaces, etc.. They exist everywhere; I can say no girl could say that she has not been mistreated in her entire life. 
### Not everyone can name a person around them who are victim or offender of sexual offense, but it's easy to find a real-life example, or to say, criminal case. Notorious rapist Jeffery Eiberstain and Warren S. Jeffs of Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey; I can already name two just in US. Sexual offense is the worst form of malice agianst women. This project is tend to analyze the victim and offender profiles of sexual offenses and dig deeper into the demographical factors that might correlate with seuxal offense, specifically in 2021.

## As the very beginning, it's important to see the trend of sexual offense cases in US in previous years, from 2013-2019.

## Observe a General Trend: Number of Rape Cases from 2013-2019 in US
###### note: After 2019, rape is categorized as sexual offense under violent crime. They share the same definition.

![13-19 trend](https://github.com/AndreaChen0301/sexual-offense-project/blob/main/project/data/images/output_6_1.png?raw=true)

### The revised definition of rape includes both female and male victims (rape), sodomy, and sextual assult with an object, where are legacy definition only includes female victims (rape). The legacy rape rate increased 15.4% from 2013 to 2019.


## Taking only one of the demographical factors--spending of policing correction per capita, compare it with the sexual offense rate of each state. The choropleth of the United State responding to sexual offense rate and policing correction spending per capita respectively in 2021. It gives a general idea of which states have higher or lower sexual offense rate, and what relationship might it has with policing spending.

## Victims Profile
#### Getting closer to the victims of sexual offense, who are they? The age and sex distribution are included in order to find the out who is more likely be targeted.

### Victims Sex Distribution

### It's evident that victims are overwhelmingly females, made up 87.4% of all victims. Now we know the sex distribution. What about age? Are the young ladies more likely to be the target? Or the immatured, vulnerable underaged girls? 

### Victim Age Distribution

![age density](https://github.com/AndreaChen0301/sexual-offense-project/blob/main/project/data/images/output_60_0.png?raw=true)

### 5 years for each age category. Left skewed curve shows that majority of the victims are in young ages, mostly between 11-15 who are vulnerable underaged teen and even children.

## Offender Profile
#### After the victims proflie, who are the offenders? What's their sex distribution, age distribution? Will these two parameters have the same pattern for victims and offenders? Besides sex and age, relationship with the victim and the offender drug+alcohol use are also included. Do the offenders know the victims? Or they are total strangers. For alcohol is always used as an justification for wrong doing, are the offenders sober when they commit crime?

### Offender Sex Distribution vs Victims Sex Distribution

### The result shows a opposite trend. The female victims outnumber the male victims while male offenders outnumber the female victims.
